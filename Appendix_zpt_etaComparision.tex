\section{$\eta_l$ studies of Z-decayed leptons}
\label{sec:eta_Z}

Comparisons of the lepton kinematics $\eta_l$ in \Zee and \Zmm channels are performed using the low pileup data and the MC datasets described in chapter \ref{sec:samples}.
The motivation is to check possible discrepancy in electron and muon performance in the analysis.
The figures are made from the inputs of Z analysis in chapters \ref{sec:Zselection} and \ref{sec:Zptmeasurement}.

In Fig~\ref{fig:etaRatio_Z}, we show the Data/MC ratios in both \Zee and \Zmm channels, with statistic, experimental systematic and luminosity uncertainty obtained from chapter \ref{sec:Zptmeasurement}.
At 5~TeV, the Data and MCs are consistent within the uncertainty. But at 13~TeV, the data is averagely above the MC, due to the luminosity.

Compatibility between \Zee and \Zmm channels is shown in~\ref{fig:etaRatio_Z}.
The binning in \Zee and \Zmm channels are different because the SF efficiency binning is used in the plots.
Therefore, we keep the statistical uncertainty bar separate for each channel, and use an approximate systematic error band of $\pm$2\% for the both channels.
The Data/MC ratio is consistent between \Zee and \Zmm channels.
