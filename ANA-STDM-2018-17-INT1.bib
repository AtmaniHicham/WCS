We describe the method in its full generality, and then specify its features in two subtraction frameworks for NLO calculations: the Catani-Seymour and the Frixione-Kunszt-Signer approach. Two examples are discussed in detail in both approaches: the production of hadrons in e+e− collisions, and the Drell-Yan vector-boson production in hadronic collisions.},

abstract = {We present the Hit Backspace Once More (HBOM) method for correcting a measurement for the effect of an imperfect detector. The HBOM method is a model-independent and potentially data-driven technique that repeatedly applies a parameterisation of the detector effects to observed data. The correction is determined, after applying the detector parameterisation, by extrapolating the data to a detector effect of zero. We demonstrate this technique using the two particle correlation function, which is an observable that can otherwise be difficult to correct for systematic shifts introduced by the detector.}
