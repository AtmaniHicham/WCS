\section{\ptz coarse bin uncertainties and results}
\label{sec:zpt_coarse_bin}

Here we present the same \ptdilep uncertainty breakdown and results plots as are shown in Section~\ref{sec:Zptmeasurement} and Section~\ref{sec:Zresult}, except that the histograms have been re-binned with the coarser binning optimized for \ut.

\caption{Complete breakdown of all of the uncertainties for \ptdilep in both \Zboson decay channels for the $\sqrt{s} = 13$~\TeV\ dataset. The uncertainties are shown as a percentage of the unfolded data per \pT bin. Each uncertainty has been unfolded using Bayesian unfolding with two iterations. Subplot (a) and (b) show the \Zee and \Zmm $p_{T}^{ll}$ uncertainties, respectively.}\end{figure}

\caption{Unfolded dilepton transverse momentum differential cross section distribution in the electron (left) and muon (right) \Zboson decay channels for the $\sqrt{s} = 13$~\TeV\ dataset. The cross section is shown in the upper panel and the lower panel shows the ratio of unfolded data to Monte Carlo distribution. The uncertainties in the ratio plot are split to show the statistical uncertainty (black error bars), statistical plus systematic uncertainties (blue band), and total uncertainty including luminosity (yellow band).}\end{figure}
