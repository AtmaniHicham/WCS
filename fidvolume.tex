\subsection{Fiducial Volume definition}
\label{sec:fidvolume}
The measurements reported here correspond to differential
Drell-Yan cross sections with a direct decay of the intermediate boson,  $Z \rightarrow \ell\ell$  or $W \rightarrow \ell\nu$, where $\ell = e$ or $\mu$.

The combined $e-\mu$-cross sections are reported in common
fiducial regions close to the initial experimental selections
so as to involve only minimal extrapolations. The kinematic
requirements applied for the cross-section measurements are
as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item  $Z \rightarrow \ell\ell$ :
$\pT^{\ell}>25~\GeV$, $|\eta^{\ell}|<2.5$, and $66~\GeV < m_{\ell\ell} <116 ~\GeV$
\item  $W \rightarrow \ell\nu$ :
$\pT^{\ell}>25~\GeV$, $|\eta^{\ell}|<2.5$, $\pT^{\nu}>25~\GeV$, and $m_{T} > 50~\GeV$
\end{itemize}

%Here the charged-lepton transverse momentum and pseudorapidity are denoted by $\pT^{\ell}$, and ,$\eta^{\ell}$ respectively. The transverse momentum of the neutrino is given by $\pT^{\nu}$ and the W boson transverse mass is calculated as $m_{T}^{2} = 2 \pT^{\ell} \pT^{\nu} [1-\cos(\Delta\phi_{\ell,\nu} )]$, where $\Delta\phi_{\ell,\nu}$ is the azimuthal angle between the charged lepton and the neutrino directions.
The lepton kinematics used in the definition of the cross sections corresponds
to the Born level for QED final-state radiation effects.

In \Wboson\ events, the \ptw\ spectrum is inferred from the observed \ut\ distribution. In \Zboson\ events, both the \ptdilep\ and \ut\ distributions are unfolded to extract the \ptz\ spectrum.
Migration matrices for the \ut-based measurement in both processes are constructed using the following baseline binnings:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \ut: 1~\GeV\ bin size up to \ut=100~\GeV, 5~\GeV\ bin size for \ut $\in$ [100, 200]~\GeV, 10~\GeV\ bin size for \ut $\in$ [200, 600]~\GeV,
  %\item \pttruthv, at 5~\TeV : [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 77, 92, 115, 145, 175, 220, 310, 600]~\GeV,
  \item \pttruthv, at 5~\TeV : [0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 77, 92, 115, 145, 175, 220, 310, 600]~\GeV,
  \item \pttruthv, at 13~\TeV : [0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 77, 92, 115, 145, 175, 220, 310, 600]~\GeV,
\end{itemize}
whereas migration matrices for the \ptdilep\ measurement in the \Zboson have the same binnings for \ptdilep\ and \pttruthv: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 33, 37, 41, 47, 53, 60, 70, 80, 100, 150, 200, 600]~\GeV.
Other binnings are explored in the \Wboson, and the corresponding results are compared in Appendix~\ref{sec:wpt_UnfBinning}.
The chosen binning in the \Wboson\ case is optimised in section~\ref{subsubsec:optimisation}, and supported by studies on the hadronic recoil resolution, given in Appendix~\ref{sec:hr_reso}.
