Reference~\cite{Sydorenko:2657116} details the muon-related performance measurements obtained using the ATLAS special with low pile-up conditions at $\sqrt{s} = 5$
TeV and $13$ TeV in view of this measurement.
Muon reconstruction and \textit{track-to-vertex association} requirements efficiencies measured
insitu with \Zmm\ events are found to be compatible with the
corresponding high-$\mu$ measurements and are measured to
permille-level precision. The muon trigger and isolation efficiencies
are measured insitu in the \lowmu\ data, for each dataset, to typically better than $<1\%$ precision, limited
by the size of the \Zmm\ data samples. Finally, the muon calibration
derived from the high-$\mu$ data has been cross-checked using both
\Zmm\ and \Jmumu\ events in the \lowmu\ datasets and has been found to be adequate at the
current level of systematics. A dedicated correction for
charge-dependent momentum biases, so-called sagitta correction, has
been derived using a combination of different methods using the $13$ TeV \lowmu dataset.
