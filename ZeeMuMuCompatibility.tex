\subsubsection{Compatibility study of the $p_{T}^{Z}$ measurements using $Z\rightarrow ee$ and $Z\rightarrow \mu\mu$ channel}
\label{sssec:compatibilityEEMuMu}
	
	{\color{blue}  This paragraph to move in the combination session ??? }
	
The measurements of $p_{T}^{Z}$ distribution are processed in two leptonic decayed channels:  $Z\rightarrow ee$ and $Z\rightarrow \mu\mu$.
The compatibility of the measurements in two channels are important validations for combination of the $p_{T}^{Z}$ results.
The measured distributions $p_{T}^{ll}$ in two channels are shown in \Fig{\ref{f:pTeeMuMu}}.
This section is based on 2GeV binning results.

Given that $Z\rightarrow ee$ and $Z\rightarrow \mu\mu$ channels are complete uncorrelated, covariance matrices are estimated independently in each channel and summed afterwards. 
Only statistic uncertainties are taken into account in the compatibility, shown in \Fig{\ref{f:CovMatricesEEMuMu}}.

%%%%%%%%% \subsubsection{Conclusion}
The $\chi^2/dof$ is 0.633 at 5~TeV and 0.975 at 13~TeV. $p_{T}^{ll}$measurements in $Z\rightarrow ee$ and $Z\rightarrow \mu\mu$ channels are well agreed.
